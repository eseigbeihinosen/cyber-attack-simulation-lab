## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a simulated cybersecurity environment designed to analyze, detect, and mitigate real-world cyber threats. It integrates offensive and defensive techniques with centralized monitoring using the ELK Stack.

> The lab simulates an attacker (Kali Linux) targeting a vulnerable server while security tools detect and respond to the activity.

---

## 🧭 Scope
This lab covers both **network-based attacks** and **web application vulnerabilities**, integrating attack simulation, detection, and defensive mechanisms within a controlled environment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate real-world cyberattacks
- Monitor malicious activities
- Implement defensive security controls
- Analyze logs using a SIEM (ELK Stack)
- Understand attack patterns and mitigation strategies

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Kali Linux  
- Ubuntu Server  
- DVWA  
- Cowrie Honeypot  
- Apache HTTP Server  
- ELK Stack  
- Filebeat  
- UFW  
- ModSecurity  

---

## ▶️ How to Reproduce (Summary)
1. Deploy Ubuntu Server with Apache and DVWA
2. Configure Cowrie honeypot on port 2222
3. Install and configure ELK Stack and Filebeat
4. Launch attacks from Kali Linux (Nmap, Metasploit, DVWA payloads)
5. Monitor logs in Kibana dashboard

---

## 🔗 Tool Roles

- **Kali Linux** → Attack simulation  
- **DVWA** → Web vulnerability testing  
- **Cowrie** → SSH honeypot logging  
- **ELK Stack** → Log analysis and visualization (SIEM)  
- **Filebeat** → Log forwarding  
- **UFW** → Network-level defense  
- **ModSecurity** → Web application firewall
